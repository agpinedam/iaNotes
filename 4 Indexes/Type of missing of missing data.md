Here’s a clear summary table comparing **MCAR**, **MAR**, and **MNAR**:

|**Type**|**Full Name**|**Missingness Depends On...**|**Example**|**Can Use Statistical Correction?**|**Difficulty Level**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**MCAR**|Missing Completely At Random|Nothing (completely random)|A survey page is left blank due to a printing error|✅ Yes – simple methods like listwise deletion|⭐️ Easiest|
|**MAR**|Missing At Random|Observed data, not the missing value|Younger people skip the income question more often (age is observed)|✅ Yes – imputation, max likelihood|⭐️⭐️ Moderate|
|**MNAR**|Missing Not At Random|The missing value itself|High earners don’t report income because it’s too high|⚠️ No – requires assumptions or modeling|⭐️⭐️⭐️ Hardest|
