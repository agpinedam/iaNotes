It happens because : 
- The missing value influences the probability of missingness
- A certain unmeasured quantity predicts the missing variable and/or the probability of missingness

### Example
People with very high income choose not to report it. So the missingness is related to the income value, which is missing â€” this is MNAR.

### Implication
MNAR is the hardest to deal with, because no observed data can fully explain the missingness. You often need external information or strong assumptions to handle it properly.
