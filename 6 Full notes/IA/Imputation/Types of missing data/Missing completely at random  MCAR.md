- There is no relationship between missingness and either observed or unobserved variables.
- Is not applicable into the real world because missing values generally involves complex relationships among observed variables and can be potentially affected by unobserved reasons.

### Example: 
A lab technician randomly forgets to enter blood pressure values for some patients, regardless of any patient characteristics.

### Implication:  

MCAR is the best-case scenario — the data is unbiased, and simple methods like listwise deletion (dropping rows) won’t introduce systematic error.
