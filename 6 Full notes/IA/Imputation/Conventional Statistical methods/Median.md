- Middle value when the numbers are ranged in order
- Shows the central tendency
- Especially useful when data has outliers
- For #continuous values
- Missing values are impute by this median
- Use **median** when data is **skewed** or has **outliers**.
- Describe income, property prices, or other economic data where values can vary widely.
- **Give a better "typical value"** when the data is not evenly distributed.

**How to calculate it:**

* Sort the numbers in ascending order.
* If the number of values is **odd**, the median is the **middle number**.
* If it's **even**, the median is the **average of the two middle numbers**.

**Example 1 (odd number of values):**
For the numbers: 3, 1, 4 â†’ Sort: 1, 3, 4
Median = **3**

**Example 2 (even number of values):**
For the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4
Median = (2 + 3) / 2 = **2.5**
